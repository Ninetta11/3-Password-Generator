### 3-Password-Generator
Assignment 3: Password Generator

## Javascript Code
I got the password generator to work however I couldnt figure out how to use a list rather than an array in a efficient manner. Also, there is one glitch that exists and that is once the user doesnt select a minimum set of characters, whilst it will loop back through, the data stored will create undefined variables within the result. If a minimum set of characters is always selected, this does not occur.
